# A-simple-rails-application-that-consists-of-a-receptionist-portal-doctor-portal--main
**Description**

Build a simple Rails application that consists of a receptionist portal and a doctor portal with the following tasks:
1.A single login page for both portals.
2.Receptionist can register a new patient and perform CRUD operations.
3.Doctor can view registered patients and view a graph representing patient registrations vs. days.


**Expectations**
1.Good quality code
2.Proper authentication implementation
3.Creativity beyond the requirements



**Steps**
**Step 1:** Set up the Rails application
Ensure that Ruby and Rails are installed on your system.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your Rails application.
Run the following command to create a new Rails application:
rails new receptionist-doctor-portal --database=postgresql
ðŸ‘† This command creates a new Rails application with PostgreSQL as the database.

Navigate into the application directory:
cd receptionist-doctor-portal


**Step 2**: Create the User model and authentication
Generate the User model and migration for authentication:
rails generate model User email:string password_digest:string role:string
ðŸ‘†This command generates a User model with email, password_digest, and role attributes.

Run the migration to create the users table in the database:
rails db:migrate
Install the bcrypt gem for password encryption. Add it to the Gemfile:
gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'
Then, run bundle install to install the gem.

Update the User model to include authentication logic. Add the following code to app/models/user.rb:
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_secure_password
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  validates :role, presence: true

  # Additional code for role-based authorization (optional)
end
This code uses the has_secure_password method provided by bcrypt to handle password encryption and authentication.



**Step 3**: Set up the login page and sessions controller
Generate a sessions controller to handle user authentication:
rails generate controller Sessions new create destroy
Update the routes (config/routes.rb) to include the login and logout routes:
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/login', to: 'sessions#new'
  post '/login', to: 'sessions#create'
  delete '/logout', to: 'sessions#destroy'

  # Additional routes for other functionalities
end
Update the sessions controller (app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb) to handle authentication:
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def new
  end

  def create
    user = User.find_by(email: params[:session][:email].downcase)
    if user && user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])
      log_in(user)
      redirect_to root_url # Modify the redirection based on the user role
    else
      flash.now[:danger] = 'Invalid email/password combination'
      render 'new'
    end
  end

  def destroy
    log_out
    redirect_to root_url
  end
end
Here, log_in and log_out are helper methods that you need to define in app/helpers/sessions_helper.rb. These methods handle session management.

**Step 4: **Create the Patient model and associated CRUD operations
Generate the Patient model and migration:
rails generate model Patient name:string age:integer
Run the migration to create the patients table in the database:
rails db:migrate
Update the Patient model (app/models/patient.rb) to include validations and associations:
class Patient < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :age, presence: true, numericality: { only_integer: true }

  # Additional code for associations with other models
end
Create the patient controller and views for CRUD operations:
rails generate controller Patients
ðŸ‘†This command generates the Patients controller and associated views.

Update the routes to include the patient routes:
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # ...

  resources :patients

  # ...
end
**Step 5:** Implement additional functionalities and customize the views
Modify the User model to include a role attribute and implement role-based authorization.
Customize the login page and views for patients based on the user's role.
Implement the graph functionality to represent patient registrations vs. days.
